# Various-Userscripts

Auto Live Watcher: Will watch YouTube streams, specific Twitch streams, or streams in a category with drops enabled automatically. Also can claim Twitch drops automatically. Will run on the "streams" page for YouTube, the "about" tab for Twitch, automatically on the drops page for Twitch, or if the script is manually run by clicking the "Watch Category" option while on a game category for Twitch. Refresh on these specific pages if the script is not running; the script will not run if you go onto these pages, only if you load these pages from a link or after refreshing on these pages.

Auto-Expand Description: Automatically expands YouTube's description.

Close Tab on Invalid Invite: This closes a https://discord.com/invite/ link if the link is invalid. Used to bruteforce a Discord invite that didn't exist, oops!

Genshin Assistant: Open a page like https://www.hoyolab.com/genshin/topicDetail/5 and then click on your Userscript manager to use the "Both of the above" option. This will like the latest 10 posts, open 5 tabs to automatically favorite and unfavorite, and also click your daily login. The favoriting and unfavoriting is automatic, so it'll happen on every post even if you didn't click the "Both of the above" option.

LoL Esports Redirector: Automatically sends you to the live page for lolesports.com and will refresh if drops aren't working. I spent a long time on this and still don't know if it's working properly.

Pick'ems Guesser: Automatically does pick'ems for you based on fan trends. Open the pick'ems page and click the button in the userscript menu.

Twitch Drop Claim: Twitch drop claimer script. No longer maintained due to being superseded by the Auto Live Watcher script.

YouTube Shorts to Videos: Redirects YouTube shorts to proper watch links instantly.
