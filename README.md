# Various-Userscripts
Add Block Button: Adds block button to Reddit posts and comments for quicker blocking.

Auto Live Watcher: Will watch YouTube streams, specific Twitch streams, or streams in a category with drops enabled automatically. Also can claim Twitch drops automatically. Will run on the "streams" page for YouTube, the "about" tab for Twitch, automatically on the drops page for Twitch, or if the script is manually run by clicking the "Watch Category" option while on a game category for Twitch. Refresh on these specific pages if the script is not running; the script will not run if you go onto these pages, only if you load these pages from a link or after refreshing on these pages.

Auto Twitch Queuer: Creates a text box to enter a list of streams and times to watch them. Use in tandem with Auto Live Watcher to automate lists of streams that aren't in a single drop category.

Faceit Watcher: Watches Faceit Live, claiming drops if available. Untested.

# Outdated Scripts
These scripts are only here for archival purposes and will get no actual support even if issues are opened about them.

Auto-Expand Description: Automatically expands YouTube's description.

Close Tab on Invalid Invite: This closes a https://discord.com/invite/ link if the link is invalid.

Genshin Assistant: Open a page like https://www.hoyolab.com/genshin/topicDetail/5 and then click on your Userscript manager to use the "Both of the above" option. This will like the latest 10 posts, open 5 tabs to automatically favorite and unfavorite, and also click your daily login. The favoriting and unfavoriting is automatic, so it'll happen on every post even if you didn't click the "Both of the above" option.
