# Various-Userscripts

Auto Live Watcher: Checks for and watches any available YouTube or Twitch live streams automatically.

Auto-Expand Description: Automatically expands YouTube's description.

Close Tab on Invalid Invite: This closes a https://discord.com/invite/ link if the link is invalid. Used to bruteforce a Discord invite that didn't exist, oops!

Genshin Assistant: Open a page like https://www.hoyolab.com/genshin/topicDetail/5 and then click on your Userscript manager to use the "Both of the above" option. This will like the latest 10 posts, open 5 tabs to automatically favorite and unfavorite, and also click your daily login. The favoriting and unfavoriting is automatic, so it'll happen on every post even if you didn't click the "Both of the above" option.

LoL Esports Redirector: Automatically sends you to the live page for lolesports.com and will refresh if drops aren't working. I spent a long time on this and still don't know if it's working properly.

Twitch Drop Claim: If you load the Twitch drop page, this extension will automatically pick it up for you.
